# 1. OVERVIEW

See Purpose.


# 2. PURPOSE

The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements which must be met by all computers connected by Mitoc Group (the "Company") lab networks to ensure effective virus detection and prevention


# 3. SCOPE

This policy applies to all Company's lab computers that are PC-based or utilize PC-file directory sharing. This includes, but is not limited to, desktop computers, laptop computers, file/ftp/tftp/proxy servers, and any PC based lab equipment such as traffic generators.


# 4. POLICY 

All Company's PC-based lab computers must have Company's standard, supported anti-virus software installed and scheduled to run at regular intervals. In addition, the anti-virus software and the virus pattern files must be kept up-to-date. Virus-infected computers must be removed from the network until they are verified as virus-free. Lab Admins/Lab Managers are responsible for creating procedures that ensure anti-virus software is run at regular intervals, and computers are verified as virus-free. Any activities with the intention to create and/or distribute malicious programs into Company's networks (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses, e-mail bombs, etc.) are prohibited, in accordance with the Acceptable Use Policy. 

4.1 Recomended processes to prevent virus problems:

* Always run the Corporate standard, supported anti-virus software is available from the corporate download site. Download and run the current version; download and install anti-virus software updates as they become available.

* NEVER open any files or macros attached to an email from an unknown, suspicious or untrustworthy source. Delete these attachments immediately, then "double delete" them by emptying your Trash.

* Delete spam, chain, and other junk email without forwarding, in with Company's Acceptable Use Policy.

* Never download files from unknown or suspicious sources.

* Avoid direct disk sharing with read/write access unless there is absolutely a business requirement to do so.

* Always scan a floppy diskette from an unknown source for viruses before using it.

* Back-up critical data and system configurations on a regular basis and store the data in a safe place.

* If lab testing conflicts with anti-virus software, run the anti-virus utility to ensure a clean machine, disable the software, then run the lab test. After the lab test, enable the antivirus software. When the anti-virus software is disabled, do not run any applications that could transfer a virus, e.g., email or file sharing.
