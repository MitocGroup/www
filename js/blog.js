Also, Amazon CloudSearch is a much better fit as a serverless option for full-text search capabilities, but we prefer Elasticsearch technology and Amazon Elasticsearch Service\u00a0instead<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Pre-requisites and Initial Considerations<\/h3>\n<p>The blue-green deployment for serverless powered applications is happening entirely on the front-end tier, mainly because all other resources from back-end, data, monitoring and security tiers are duplicated and therefore are NOT altered during this process. So, going forward, we\u2019ll be describing only the changes that will be applied to Amazon Route53, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 during any serverless blue-green deployment.<\/p>\n<p>The simplest and most straight-forward approach to blue-green deployments for serverless powered applications is to switch all traffic from blue environment to green environment on DNS level (and in case of failures, rollback from green environment to blue environment).<\/p>\n<p>Managing DNS records can be sometimes very tricky, mainly because the propagation might take unpredictable time due to various caching layers on Internet. But our experience with Amazon Route53 is amazing, as long as we are using A alias records instead of CNAME records. Here below are 3 screenshots from AWS Management Console that shows how we\u2019ve setup <em>www1.adtechmedia.io<\/em> in Amazon Route53, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon\u00a0S3:<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/499\/1*eyHXfrtj3O7wSQGU20ZZlg.png\"><figcaption>aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id [YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*s6ophCTwEI7j0hPlgYD8oQ.png\"><figcaption>aws cloudfront get-distribution --id [YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*FZ1I554l1F9AzzdLJ2_GEA.png\"><figcaption>aws s3 website s3:\/\/www1.adtechmedia.io\/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html<\/figcaption><\/figure><h3>Blue\/Green Deployments v1<\/h3>\n<p>At this point, we are ready to switch from blue environment to green environment with zero downtime and low risks. The switch is quite\u00a0simple:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Update CloudFront distribution for blue environment by removing <em>www1.adtechmedia.io<\/em> from Alternative Domain Names\u00a0(CNAMEs)<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*9k7mIBYt5JLIgtPwNuZb7A.png\"><figcaption>aws cloudfront update-distribution --distribution-config file:\/\/distconfig-disabled.json --id [YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Update CloudFront distribution for green environment by adding <em>www1.adtechmedia.io<\/em> to Alternative Domain Names\u00a0(CNAMEs)<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*gpvcH-JV7ofL6W20xWL6xg.png\"><figcaption>aws cloudfront update-distribution --distribution-config file:\/\/distconfig-disabled.json --id [YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Update Route53 A alias record with CloudFront distribution Domain Name from green environment<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/499\/1*uzyuegTk4QBWPkfU8TIGMw.png\"><figcaption>aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --change-batch file:\/\/resource-record.json --hosted-zone-id [YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>If, for some unexpected reason, your green environment starts generating high level of failures, the rollback process is pretty similar to the one described above:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove CNAME from green environment<\/li>\n<li>Add CNAME to blue environment<\/li>\n<li>Update Amazon Route53 with blue environment Domain\u00a0Name<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote>UPDATE on 11\/03\/2016: A friend pointed out that it\u2019s not necessarily to add\/remove CNAMEs (which could take up to 20 minutes to propagate). Instead, just leave blue environment as it is (e.g. www1.adtechmedia.io) and setup wild carded CNAME on green environment (e.g. *.adtechmedia.io). When both distributions are enabled, blue will take precedence over green, making sure you\u2019re not stuck with new deploy in case of high level of failures.<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Blue\/Green Deployments v2<\/h3>\n<p>As you have seen in the previous blue-green deployments process the traffic between environments is switched suddenly, at 100% capacity. This is great for zero downtime, but if your application starts to fail, all of your users are affected. Some modern continuous deployment technics promote a more gradual switch of the traffic between environments. For example, we push only 5% of requests to green environment, while 95% still goes to blue environment. This allows to detect production problems early and on a much smaller audience of users, problems that have never surfaced in testing and staging phases. Is it possible to enable such an approach for serverless powered applications?<\/p>\n<p>Short answer, yes! We\u2019re very excited and humble to be able to explain our serverless solution, but there are some additional pre-requisites that must happen before. Let\u2019s describe the challenge first, and then jump into our implementation and pre-requisites.<\/p>\n<h4>The Challenge<\/h4>\n<p>Amazon CloudFront, the way it is designed, doesn\u2019t allow same CNAME on multiple distributions. That is also the reason why we\u2019re removing it from the blue environment and adding it to the green environment in our previous implementation.<\/p>\n<h4>Our implementation<\/h4>\n<p>Amazon Route53 allows weighted routing of the traffic across multiple Amazon CloudFront distributions, Amazon S3 static websites and other endpoints. So, instead of load balancing requests between distributions, we are changing current A alias record that points to blue environment from simple routing to weighted routing, and add another A alias record as green environment that points directly to Amazon S3 static website endpoint. This enables us to manipulate requests across environments as we wish: 95% vs 5% (as shown in the screenshot below), then (if everything is fine) 90% vs 10%, and so on until blue is 0% and green is\u00a0100%.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*CNgsS6Ymii3uYKIqcGqOuQ.png\"><figcaption>aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --change-batch file:\/\/resource-record.json --hosted-zone-id [YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>All changes are made on Amazon Route53 level, without altering Amazon CloudFront or Amazon S3 resources.

Also, Amazon CloudSearch is a much better fit as a serverless option for full-text search capabilities, but we prefer Elasticsearch technology and Amazon Elasticsearch Service\u00a0instead<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Pre-requisites and Initial Considerations<\/h3>\n<p>The blue-green deployment for serverless powered applications is happening entirely on the front-end tier, mainly because all other resources from back-end, data, monitoring and security tiers are duplicated and therefore are NOT altered during this process. So, going forward, we\u2019ll be describing only the changes that will be applied to Amazon Route53, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 during any serverless blue-green deployment.<\/p>\n<p>The simplest and most straight-forward approach to blue-green deployments for serverless powered applications is to switch all traffic from blue environment to green environment on DNS level (and in case of failures, rollback from green environment to blue environment).<\/p>\n<p>Managing DNS records can be sometimes very tricky, mainly because the propagation might take unpredictable time due to various caching layers on Internet. But our experience with Amazon Route53 is amazing, as long as we are using A alias records instead of CNAME records. Here below are 3 screenshots from AWS Management Console that shows how we\u2019ve setup <em>www1.adtechmedia.io<\/em> in Amazon Route53, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon\u00a0S3:<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/499\/1*eyHXfrtj3O7wSQGU20ZZlg.png\"><figcaption>aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id [YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*s6ophCTwEI7j0hPlgYD8oQ.png\"><figcaption>aws cloudfront get-distribution --id [YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*FZ1I554l1F9AzzdLJ2_GEA.png\"><figcaption>aws s3 website s3:\/\/www1.adtechmedia.io\/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html<\/figcaption><\/figure><h3>Blue\/Green Deployments v1<\/h3>\n<p>At this point, we are ready to switch from blue environment to green environment with zero downtime and low risks. The switch is quite\u00a0simple:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Update CloudFront distribution for blue environment by removing <em>www1.adtechmedia.io<\/em> from Alternative Domain Names\u00a0(CNAMEs)<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*9k7mIBYt5JLIgtPwNuZb7A.png\"><figcaption>aws cloudfront update-distribution --distribution-config file:\/\/distconfig-disabled.json --id [YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Update CloudFront distribution for green environment by adding <em>www1.adtechmedia.io<\/em> to Alternative Domain Names\u00a0(CNAMEs)<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*gpvcH-JV7ofL6W20xWL6xg.png\"><figcaption>aws cloudfront update-distribution --distribution-config file:\/\/distconfig-disabled.json --id [YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Update Route53 A alias record with CloudFront distribution Domain Name from green environment<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/499\/1*uzyuegTk4QBWPkfU8TIGMw.png\"><figcaption>aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --change-batch file:\/\/resource-record.json --hosted-zone-id [YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>If, for some unexpected reason, your green environment starts generating high level of failures, the rollback process is pretty similar to the one described above:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove CNAME from green environment<\/li>\n<li>Add CNAME to blue environment<\/li>\n<li>Update Amazon Route53 with blue environment Domain\u00a0Name<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote>UPDATE on 11\/03\/2016: A friend pointed out that it\u2019s not necessarily to add\/remove CNAMEs (which could take up to 20 minutes to propagate). Instead, just leave blue environment as it is (e.g. www1.adtechmedia.io) and setup wild carded CNAME on green environment (e.g. *.adtechmedia.io). When both distributions are enabled, blue will take precedence over green, making sure you\u2019re not stuck with new deploy in case of high level of failures.<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Blue\/Green Deployments v2<\/h3>\n<p>As you have seen in the previous blue-green deployments process the traffic between environments is switched suddenly, at 100% capacity. This is great for zero downtime, but if your application starts to fail, all of your users are affected. Some modern continuous deployment technics promote a more gradual switch of the traffic between environments. For example, we push only 5% of requests to green environment, while 95% still goes to blue environment. This allows to detect production problems early and on a much smaller audience of users, problems that have never surfaced in testing and staging phases. Is it possible to enable such an approach for serverless powered applications?<\/p>\n<p>Short answer, yes! We\u2019re very excited and humble to be able to explain our serverless solution, but there are some additional pre-requisites that must happen before. Let\u2019s describe the challenge first, and then jump into our implementation and pre-requisites.<\/p>\n<h4>The Challenge<\/h4>\n<p>Amazon CloudFront, the way it is designed, doesn\u2019t allow same CNAME on multiple distributions. That is also the reason why we\u2019re removing it from the blue environment and adding it to the green environment in our previous implementation.<\/p>\n<h4>Our implementation<\/h4>\n<p>Amazon Route53 allows weighted routing of the traffic across multiple Amazon CloudFront distributions, Amazon S3 static websites and other endpoints. So, instead of load balancing requests between distributions, we are changing current A alias record that points to blue environment from simple routing to weighted routing, and add another A alias record as green environment that points directly to Amazon S3 static website endpoint. This enables us to manipulate requests across environments as we wish: 95% vs 5% (as shown in the screenshot below), then (if everything is fine) 90% vs 10%, and so on until blue is 0% and green is\u00a0100%.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1024\/1*CNgsS6Ymii3uYKIqcGqOuQ.png\"><figcaption>aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --change-batch file:\/\/resource-record.json --hosted-zone-id [YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID]<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>All changes are made on Amazon Route53 level, without altering Amazon CloudFront or Amazon S3 resources. And compared to previous blue-green deployment, rollback process is even faster and easier. We remove A alias record of green environment and we\u2019re done! Well, almost done... For consistency and cost saving purposes, we also revert back A alias record of blue environment from weighted routing to simple\u00a0routing.<\/p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts and Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>What are the down sizes (pre-requisites) of the blue-green deployments v2?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Amazon S3 static website hosting doesn\u2019t support SSL, so we find ourselves temporarily enforcing HTTP-only during blue-green deployment<\/li>\n<li>Amazon S3 static endpoint can be used with Amazon Route53 A alias only if the bucket name is the same with the domain name (e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adtechmedia.io)\/\">www.adtechmedia.io)<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li>Depends on the traffic size, specifically how much TPS you\u2019re consuming, Amazon S3 might start throttling you (more details here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AmazonS3\/latest\/dev\/request-rate-perf-considerations.html\">Request Rate and Performance Considerations<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet that would work perfectly for any serverless powered applications on AWS.

Eugene Istrati, Technology Partner at Mitoc Group, will dive deep into our approach to microservices architecture using serverless environments from AWS and demonstrate how anyone can use serverless computing to achieve high scalability, high availability, and high performance without huge efforts or expensive resources allocation.<\/p>\n<p>Eugene Istrati has spent over 15 years as a technologist in a variety of industries, including digital media, cloud computing, and reputation marketing. Before joining Mitoc Group as Technology Partner, Eugene worked as Director of Engineering at Hearst Corporation and Program Manager at Amazon Web Services. He holds a dual Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering.<\/p>\n<p>So, are you ready for StackWorld 2016?

The tasks management is processed by AWS Lambda, optionally behind Amazon API Gateway (the back-end tier). The tasks metadata is stored in Amazon DynamoDB (the data tier). The transformed todo app, along with instructions on how to install and deploy this web application, is described in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mitocgroup.com\/building-scalable-web-apps-with-aws-lambda-and-home-grown-serverless-web-framework-e04c912d08f0\">this blog post<\/a> and the code is available on\u00a0Github:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\">MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In this article, we will focus on AWS Lambda functions and the value proposition it offers to us and our customers.<\/p>\n<h4>AWS Lambda Functions<\/h4>\n<p>Let\u2019s get into the details of the thinking process and the AWS Lambda functions that we have written for this web app. The goal of the todo app is to manage tasks in a self-service mode. End users can view tasks, create new tasks, mark or unmark a task as done, and clear completed tasks. From UI and UX point of view, that leads us to 4 user interactions that will require 4 different back-end\u00a0calls:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>web service that retrieves task(s)<\/li>\n<li>web service that creates\u00a0task(s)<\/li>\n<li>web service that deletes\u00a0task(s)<\/li>\n<li>web service that updates\u00a0task(s)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Simple reorder of the above identified back-end calls leads us to basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on the Task data object. And these are the simple logical steps that we take to identify the front-end, the back-end and the data tiers of (drums beating, trumpets playing) our approach to microservices, which we prefer to call microapplications.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, coming back to AWS Lambda, we have written 4 small node.js functions that are context-bounded and self-sustained (each below microservice corresponds to the above identified back-end web service):<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/6a93eb9123385b5ae3c5dc72fe617116\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/6a93eb9123385b5ae3c5dc72fe617116\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/498052c98b9843a59f3f5a585c41209a\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/498052c98b9843a59f3f5a585c41209a\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2265dd062f88b2188cf3da5d75fe7367\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2265dd062f88b2188cf3da5d75fe7367\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/76703e7027cbda742658d1d5eb8d5bf0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/76703e7027cbda742658d1d5eb8d5bf0\/href<\/a><p>Each above file with related dependencies is compressed into\u00a0.zip file and uploaded to AWS Lambda. If you\u2019re new to this process, we\u2019d strongly recommend to follow <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AWSToolkitEclipse\/latest\/ug\/lambda-tutorial.html\">How to Create, Upload and Invoke an AWS Lambda function<\/a> tutorial.<\/p>\n<p>Back to our 4 small node.js functions, you can see that we have adopted ES6 (aka <a href=\"https:\/\/babeljs.io\/docs\/learn-es2015\">ES2015<\/a>) as our coding standard. And we are importing <em>deep-framework<\/em> in every function. What is this framework anyway and why we\u2019re using it everywhere?<\/p>\n<h4>Full-stack Web Framework<\/h4>\n<p>Let us step back. Building and uploading AWS Lambda functions to the service is very simple and straight-forward, but now imagine you need to manage <a href=\"http:\/\/highscalability.com\/blog\/2007\/9\/18\/amazon-architecture.html\">100\u2013150 web services to access a web page<\/a>, multiplied by hundreds or thousands of web\u00a0pages.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that the only way to achieve this kind of flexibility and scale is automation and code reuse. These principles led us to build and open source <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework\">DEEP Framework<\/a>\u200a\u2014\u200aa full-stack web framework that abstracts web services and web applications from specific cloud services\u200a\u2014\u200aand DEEP CLI (aka <em>deepify)<\/em>\u200a\u2014\u200adevelopment tool-chain that abstracts package management and associated development operations.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, to make sure that the process of managing AWS Lambda functions is streamlined and automated, we have adopted a consistent approach to include 2 more files in each uploaded\u00a0.zip:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c6a0b6ae47ceb5b97b60250277d9e28\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c6a0b6ae47ceb5b97b60250277d9e28\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d3fa53fb655562079f6b2078a52ff0f0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d3fa53fb655562079f6b2078a52ff0f0\/href<\/a><p>Having these 3 files (Handler.es6, bootstrap.es6 and package.json) in each AWS Lambda function doesn\u2019t mean your final\u00a0.zip file will be that small. Actually, a lot of additional operations happen before the\u00a0.zip file is created. To name\u00a0few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS Lambda performs better when the uploaded codebase is smaller. Since we provide both local development capabilities and one-step push to production, our process optimizes resources before deploying to\u00a0AWS.<\/li>\n<li>ES6 is not supported by node.js v0.10.x that currently runs in AWS Lambda. We compile\u00a0.es6 files into ES5 compliant\u00a0.js files using\u00a0babel.<\/li>\n<li>Dependencies that are defined in package.json are automatically pulled and fine tuned for node.js v0.10.x to provide best performance possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Putting Everything Together<\/h4>\n<p>First, you will need the following pre-requisites:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>AWS Account (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WviHsoz8yHk\">Create an Amazon Web Services\u00a0Account<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>AWS CLI (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/cli\/latest\/userguide\/cli-chap-getting-started.html\">Configure AWS Command Line Interface<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Git v2+ (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/git-scm.com\/book\/en\/v2\/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">Get Started\u200a\u2014\u200aInstalling Git<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Java \/ JRE v6+ (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/8\/docs\/technotes\/guides\/install\/install_overview.html\">JDK 8 and JRE 8 Installation Start\u00a0Here<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Node.js v4+ (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/creationix\/nvm#install-script\">Install nvm<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/creationix\/nvm#usage\">Use latest node\u00a0v4<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>DEEP CLI (execute in command line: <em>npm install deepify\u00a0-g<\/em>)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><em>Note: Don\u2019t use \u201csudo\u201d in step 5.

The beauty of cloud-native approach is that security comes by design (in other words, it won\u2019t work otherwise). We take full advantage of shared responsibility model and enforce security in every\u00a0layer.<\/p>\n<p>Developers and applications\u2019 end users benefit of <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/IAM\/latest\/UserGuide\/best-practices.html\">AWS IAM best practices<\/a> through streamlined implementations of <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/IAM\/latest\/UserGuide\/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege\">least privilege access<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/IAM\/latest\/UserGuide\/best-practices.html#delegate-using-roles\">delegated roles instead of credentials<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/IAM\/latest\/UserGuide\/best-practices.html#keep-a-log\">integration with logging and monitoring services<\/a> (e.g. AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Elasticsearch + Kibana). For example, developers and end users of todo app didn\u2019t need to explicitly define any security roles (it was done by <em>deepify deploy<\/em>), but they can rest assured that only their instance of todo app will be using their infrastructure &amp; platform &amp; application resources.<\/p>\n<p>Here below are 2 security roles (1 for back-end and 1 for front-end) that have been seamlessly generated and enforced in each\u00a0layer:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c59ecd0b28e5def9953b31b553eabb0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c59ecd0b28e5def9953b31b553eabb0\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/b48f1ad72cb25e6d3b3fbbae1fdd04af\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/b48f1ad72cb25e6d3b3fbbae1fdd04af\/href<\/a><h4>Benchmarking<\/h4>\n<p>We have been continuously benchmarking AWS Lambda for various use cases in our microapplications.

The key is to build the functions as small as possible, focusing on a simple rule of one function to achieve only one task. Over time, these functions might grow in size, therefore we always keep an eye on them and refactor \/ split into the lowest possible logical denominator (smallest task).<\/p>\n<p>Using the benchmarking tool, we ran multiple scenarios on the same function from todo\u00a0app:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/f32ffcf4ffb607742398039975f3a993\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/f32ffcf4ffb607742398039975f3a993\/href<\/a><p>Based on performance data, we have learned pretty cool\u00a0stuff:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The smaller the function is, the better it performs; On the other hand, if more memory is allocated, the size of the function matters less and\u00a0less<\/li>\n<li>Memory size is not directly proportional to billable costs; Developers can decide the memory size based on performance requirements combined with associated costs<\/li>\n<li>The key to better performance is continuous load, thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/compute\/container-reuse-in-lambda\">container reuse in AWS\u00a0Lambda<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>In this article, we have presented a small web application that is built with AWS Lambda at core.

The original version can be seen on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.todomvc.com,\/\">www.todomvc.com<\/a> and the original code can be downloaded from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/tastejs\/todomvc\/tree\/master\/examples\/angularjs\">https:\/\/github.com\/tastejs\/todomvc\/tree\/master\/examples\/angularjs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The architecture of every web application we build or transform, including the one described above, is similar to the reference architecture of the realtime voting application published recently by AWS on\u00a0Github:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/awslabs\/lambda-refarch-webapp\">awslabs\/lambda-refarch-webapp<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The todo app is written in AngularJS and deployed on Amazon S3, behind Amazon CloudFront (the front-end tier). The tasks management is processed by AWS Lambda, optionally behind Amazon API Gateway (the back-end tier). The tasks metadata is stored in Amazon DynamoDB (the data tier). The transformed todo app, along with instructions on how to install and deploy this web application, is described in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mitocgroup.com\/building-scalable-web-apps-with-aws-lambda-and-home-grown-serverless-web-framework-e04c912d08f0\">this blog post<\/a> and the code is available on\u00a0Github:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\">MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In this article, we will focus on AWS Lambda functions and the value proposition it offers to us and our customers.<\/p>\n<h4>AWS Lambda Functions<\/h4>\n<p>Let\u2019s get into the details of the thinking process and the AWS Lambda functions that we have written for this web app. The goal of the todo app is to manage tasks in a self-service mode. End users can view tasks, create new tasks, mark or unmark a task as done, and clear completed tasks. From UI and UX point of view, that leads us to 4 user interactions that will require 4 different back-end\u00a0calls:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>web service that retrieves task(s)<\/li>\n<li>web service that creates\u00a0task(s)<\/li>\n<li>web service that deletes\u00a0task(s)<\/li>\n<li>web service that updates\u00a0task(s)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Simple reorder of the above identified back-end calls leads us to basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on the Task data object. And these are the simple logical steps that we take to identify the front-end, the back-end and the data tiers of (drums beating, trumpets playing) our approach to microservices, which we prefer to call microapplications.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, coming back to AWS Lambda, we have written 4 small node.js functions that are context-bounded and self-sustained (each below microservice corresponds to the above identified back-end web service):<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/6a93eb9123385b5ae3c5dc72fe617116\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/6a93eb9123385b5ae3c5dc72fe617116\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/498052c98b9843a59f3f5a585c41209a\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/498052c98b9843a59f3f5a585c41209a\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2265dd062f88b2188cf3da5d75fe7367\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2265dd062f88b2188cf3da5d75fe7367\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/76703e7027cbda742658d1d5eb8d5bf0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/76703e7027cbda742658d1d5eb8d5bf0\/href<\/a><p>Each above file with related dependencies is compressed into\u00a0.zip file and uploaded to AWS Lambda. If you\u2019re new to this process, we\u2019d strongly recommend to follow <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AWSToolkitEclipse\/latest\/ug\/lambda-tutorial.html\">How to Create, Upload and Invoke an AWS Lambda function<\/a> tutorial.<\/p>\n<p>Back to our 4 small node.js functions, you can see that we have adopted ES6 (aka <a href=\"https:\/\/babeljs.io\/docs\/learn-es2015\">ES2015<\/a>) as our coding standard. And we are importing <em>deep-framework<\/em> in every function. What is this framework anyway and why we\u2019re using it everywhere?<\/p>\n<h4>Full-stack Web Framework<\/h4>\n<p>Let us step back. Building and uploading AWS Lambda functions to the service is very simple and straight-forward, but now imagine you need to manage <a href=\"http:\/\/highscalability.com\/blog\/2007\/9\/18\/amazon-architecture.html\">100\u2013150 web services to access a web page<\/a>, multiplied by hundreds or thousands of web\u00a0pages.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that the only way to achieve this kind of flexibility and scale is automation and code reuse. These principles led us to build and open source <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework\">DEEP Framework<\/a>\u200a\u2014\u200aa full-stack web framework that abstracts web services and web applications from specific cloud services\u200a\u2014\u200aand DEEP CLI (aka <em>deepify)<\/em>\u200a\u2014\u200adevelopment tool-chain that abstracts package management and associated development operations.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, to make sure that the process of managing AWS Lambda functions is streamlined and automated, we have adopted a consistent approach to include 2 more files in each uploaded\u00a0.zip:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c6a0b6ae47ceb5b97b60250277d9e28\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c6a0b6ae47ceb5b97b60250277d9e28\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d3fa53fb655562079f6b2078a52ff0f0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d3fa53fb655562079f6b2078a52ff0f0\/href<\/a><p>Having these 3 files (Handler.es6, bootstrap.es6 and package.json) in each AWS Lambda function doesn\u2019t mean your final\u00a0.zip file will be that small. Actually, a lot of additional operations happen before the\u00a0.zip file is created. To name\u00a0few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS Lambda performs better when the uploaded codebase is smaller. Since we provide both local development capabilities and one-step push to production, our process optimizes resources before deploying to\u00a0AWS.<\/li>\n<li>ES6 is not supported by node.js v0.10.x that currently runs in AWS Lambda. We compile\u00a0.es6 files into ES5 compliant\u00a0.js files using\u00a0babel.<\/li>\n<li>Dependencies that are defined in package.json are automatically pulled and fine tuned for node.js v0.10.x to provide best performance possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Putting Everything Together<\/h4>\n<p>First, you will need the following pre-requisites:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>AWS Account (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WviHsoz8yHk\">Create an Amazon Web Services\u00a0Account<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>AWS CLI (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/cli\/latest\/userguide\/cli-chap-getting-started.html\">Configure AWS Command Line Interface<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Git v2+ (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/git-scm.com\/book\/en\/v2\/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">Get Started\u200a\u2014\u200aInstalling Git<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Java \/ JRE v6+ (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/8\/docs\/technotes\/guides\/install\/install_overview.html\">JDK 8 and JRE 8 Installation Start\u00a0Here<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Node.js v4+ (learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/creationix\/nvm#install-script\">Install nvm<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/creationix\/nvm#usage\">Use latest node\u00a0v4<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>DEEP CLI (execute in command line: <em>npm install deepify\u00a0-g<\/em>)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><em>Note: Don\u2019t use \u201csudo\u201d in step 5.

If only there was a simple command that would clean up everything when we\u2019re done. We thought of that and created <em>deepify undeploy<\/em> to address this need.

And what about security?<\/p>\n<h4>Security<\/h4>\n<p>Well, one of the biggest value propositions on AWS is out-of-the-box <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/security\/\">security<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/compliance\/\">compliance<\/a>. The beauty of cloud-native approach is that security comes by design (in other words, it won\u2019t work otherwise). We take full advantage of shared responsibility model and enforce security in every\u00a0layer.<\/p>\n<p>Developers and applications\u2019 end users benefit of <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/IAM\/latest\/UserGuide\/best-practices.html\">AWS IAM best practices<\/a> through streamlined implementations of <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/IAM\/latest\/UserGuide\/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege\">least privilege access<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/IAM\/latest\/UserGuide\/best-practices.html#delegate-using-roles\">delegated roles instead of credentials<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/IAM\/latest\/UserGuide\/best-practices.html#keep-a-log\">integration with logging and monitoring services<\/a> (e.g. AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Elasticsearch + Kibana). For example, developers and end users of todo app didn\u2019t need to explicitly define any security roles (it was done by <em>deepify deploy<\/em>), but they can rest assured that only their instance of todo app will be using their infrastructure &amp; platform &amp; application resources.<\/p>\n<p>Here below are 2 security roles (1 for back-end and 1 for front-end) that have been seamlessly generated and enforced in each\u00a0layer:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c59ecd0b28e5def9953b31b553eabb0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c59ecd0b28e5def9953b31b553eabb0\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/b48f1ad72cb25e6d3b3fbbae1fdd04af\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/b48f1ad72cb25e6d3b3fbbae1fdd04af\/href<\/a><h4>Benchmarking<\/h4>\n<p>We have been continuously benchmarking AWS Lambda for various use cases in our microapplications. After a couple of repetitive times doing similar analysis, we decided to build the benchmarking as another microapplication and reuse the ecosystem to automatically include where we needed it. The codebase is open sourced on\u00a0Github:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-benchmarking\">MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-benchmarking<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Particularly, for todo app, we have performed various benchmarking analysis on AWS Lambda by tweaking different components in a specific function (e.g. function size, memory size, billable cost, etc.). Next, we would like to share results with\u00a0you:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/5db7ed11b7792b177d48553642ec4d99\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/5db7ed11b7792b177d48553642ec4d99\/href<\/a><h4>Performance<\/h4>\n<p>Speaking of performance, we find AWS Lambda mature enough to power large-scale web applications. The key is to build the functions as small as possible, focusing on a simple rule of one function to achieve only one task. Over time, these functions might grow in size, therefore we always keep an eye on them and refactor \/ split into the lowest possible logical denominator (smallest task).<\/p>\n<p>Using the benchmarking tool, we ran multiple scenarios on the same function from todo\u00a0app:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/f32ffcf4ffb607742398039975f3a993\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/f32ffcf4ffb607742398039975f3a993\/href<\/a><p>Based on performance data, we have learned pretty cool\u00a0stuff:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The smaller the function is, the better it performs; On the other hand, if more memory is allocated, the size of the function matters less and\u00a0less<\/li>\n<li>Memory size is not directly proportional to billable costs; Developers can decide the memory size based on performance requirements combined with associated costs<\/li>\n<li>The key to better performance is continuous load, thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/compute\/container-reuse-in-lambda\">container reuse in AWS\u00a0Lambda<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\n<p>In this article, we have presented a small web application that is built with AWS Lambda at core. Together we walked through the thinking process of identifying the front-end, the back-end and the data tiers required to build the todo app. We focused on the structure of AWS Lambda functions used in this app, as well as security, performance and benchmarking steps that we use to build enterprise-level web applications.

Every frontend interaction is powered by a backend service that talks to a data tier. The web application is a collection of web components (we call them microapplications). Every web component consists of a frontend, backend, database, security, tests and docs. And every microapplication manages the entire technology stack, starting with infrastructure services, going up to platform services and concluding with application services, everything packaged as a well-structured codebase.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: Docs and tests are very important components of every microapplication, but we decided to leave them out of scope for this\u00a0article.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive into the details of every tier\u00a0next\u2026<\/p>\n<h4>Building Frontend<\/h4>\n<p>The structure of our frontend is concentrated into: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Frontend\/bootstrap.js\">bootstrap.js<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Frontend\/package.json\">package.json<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/tree\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Frontend\/js\/\">js\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/7ef6db568e94927ef55d3b02e482b56e\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/7ef6db568e94927ef55d3b02e482b56e\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/59ce2ee7b1f4b8d116b8701bee8288ef\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/59ce2ee7b1f4b8d116b8701bee8288ef\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/a6d39873c769c779ed14943e4e4c4171\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/a6d39873c769c779ed14943e4e4c4171\/href<\/a><p>As was mentioned earlier in this post, this todo app was inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.todomvc.com\/\">www.todomvc.com<\/a>. In practice, it means that we took <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/tastejs\/todomvc\/tree\/master\/examples\/angularjs\">the sample code from GitHub<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-helloworld\">ported using Hello World as reference<\/a>. Reusing code allows us to be both consistent and\u00a0fast.<\/p>\n<p>Microservices architecture can be challenging sometimes. We found very useful the process of building a feature or a service first, and then break it down into microservices. Using this approach on todo app helped us take the code as it was, replace <a href=\"https:\/\/angularjs.org\/\">AngularJS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/angular-ui\/ui-router\">AngularUI Router<\/a> modules with <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-root-angularjs\">DEEP Microservices Root AngularJS<\/a>, and transform the storage service using resource library from DEEP Framework.<\/p>\n<h4>Building Backend<\/h4>\n<p>The structure of our backend is reduced to: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/resources.json\">resources.json<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/tree\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/src\/\">src\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/a2398079974810e1abef0a88383b2c84\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/a2398079974810e1abef0a88383b2c84\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/c0da5738f43fd83cef7cee6b0c2f9ed5\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/c0da5738f43fd83cef7cee6b0c2f9ed5\/href<\/a><p>When the UI and UX were defined, building the web services to support this frontend were intuitively easy. We are using RESTful APIs that provide CRUD (aka Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete) operations for each logically independent entity. In our case the entity is the todo task, and our todo app is supposed to offer functionality to create tasks, retrieve them, update or\u00a0delete.<\/p>\n<p>Each web service we use is very small, completely independent, highly decoupled, focused on context bounded one task, communicating through language-agnostic API. This is the very definition of a microservice, which we adopted by choice and by necessity. And this is where AWS Lambda\u00a0excels!<\/p>\n<p>Next, we will describe the structure of the \u201cCreate Todo\u201d microservice that we deploy on AWS Lambda (the other microservices in this todo app are structured pretty much the same): <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/src\/Todo\/Create\/bootstrap.es6\">bootstrap.es6<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/src\/Todo\/Create\/package.json\">package.json<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/src\/Todo\/Create\/Handler.es6\">Handler.es6<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c6a0b6ae47ceb5b97b60250277d9e28\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c6a0b6ae47ceb5b97b60250277d9e28\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d3fa53fb655562079f6b2078a52ff0f0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d3fa53fb655562079f6b2078a52ff0f0\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/cae137a2d3350125d0f490a29025c7c1\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/cae137a2d3350125d0f490a29025c7c1\/href<\/a><h4>Building Database<\/h4>\n<p>The structure of our database model is trivial, just one file: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Data\/Models\/Todo.json\">Todo.json<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/e4baf60cd4213b0d666196b7a357524d\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/e4baf60cd4213b0d666196b7a357524d\/href<\/a><p>Since we\u2019re using a NoSQL database like Amazon DynamoDB, the only piece of information that the database library from DEEP Framework cares about is the table name and the primary key. Everything else is handled by the library itself, as long as it\u2019s in json\u00a0format.<\/p>\n<h4>Enforcing Security<\/h4>\n<p>The beauty of cloud-native approach is that security comes by design. When we deploy todo app, <em>deepify<\/em> automatically identifies the web services involved in the process and creates corresponding security roles. On backend and database tiers these roles are transposed into AWS IAM roles, while on frontend tier we automatically compile them and expose in the UI as Access Control Lists (also known as ACLs). Let\u2019s see some examples:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/b48f1ad72cb25e6d3b3fbbae1fdd04af\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/b48f1ad72cb25e6d3b3fbbae1fdd04af\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c59ecd0b28e5def9953b31b553eabb0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c59ecd0b28e5def9953b31b553eabb0\/href<\/a><h4>Putting Everything Together<\/h4>\n<p>Now that we\u2019re done with frontend, backend, database and security, it\u2019s time to glue everything together and put all web components into\u00a0action:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/18363867fa2132849cbd705a78bf99c1\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/18363867fa2132849cbd705a78bf99c1\/href<\/a><p>There are two more components in the root path of the microapplication that are critical: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/deepkg.json\">deepkg.json<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/parameters.json\">parameters.json<\/a>. Similar to Node Package Manager (also know as <em>npm<\/em>), our command line tool DEEP CLI (also known as <em>deepify)<\/em> is looking for metadata (in this case\u200a\u2014\u200adeepkg.json) and configuration (in this case\u200a\u2014\u200aparameters.json) files.

Every frontend interaction is powered by a backend service that talks to a data tier. The web application is a collection of web components (we call them microapplications). Every web component consists of a frontend, backend, database, security, tests and docs. And every microapplication manages the entire technology stack, starting with infrastructure services, going up to platform services and concluding with application services, everything packaged as a well-structured codebase.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: Docs and tests are very important components of every microapplication, but we decided to leave them out of scope for this\u00a0article.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive into the details of every tier\u00a0next\u2026<\/p>\n<h4>Building Frontend<\/h4>\n<p>The structure of our frontend is concentrated into: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Frontend\/bootstrap.js\">bootstrap.js<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Frontend\/package.json\">package.json<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/tree\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Frontend\/js\/\">js\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/7ef6db568e94927ef55d3b02e482b56e\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/7ef6db568e94927ef55d3b02e482b56e\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/59ce2ee7b1f4b8d116b8701bee8288ef\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/59ce2ee7b1f4b8d116b8701bee8288ef\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/a6d39873c769c779ed14943e4e4c4171\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/a6d39873c769c779ed14943e4e4c4171\/href<\/a><p>As was mentioned earlier in this post, this todo app was inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.todomvc.com\/\">www.todomvc.com<\/a>. In practice, it means that we took <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/tastejs\/todomvc\/tree\/master\/examples\/angularjs\">the sample code from GitHub<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-helloworld\">ported using Hello World as reference<\/a>. Reusing code allows us to be both consistent and\u00a0fast.<\/p>\n<p>Microservices architecture can be challenging sometimes. We found very useful the process of building a feature or a service first, and then break it down into microservices. Using this approach on todo app helped us take the code as it was, replace <a href=\"https:\/\/angularjs.org\/\">AngularJS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/angular-ui\/ui-router\">AngularUI Router<\/a> modules with <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-root-angularjs\">DEEP Microservices Root AngularJS<\/a>, and transform the storage service using resource library from DEEP Framework.<\/p>\n<h4>Building Backend<\/h4>\n<p>The structure of our backend is reduced to: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/resources.json\">resources.json<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/tree\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/src\/\">src\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/a2398079974810e1abef0a88383b2c84\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/a2398079974810e1abef0a88383b2c84\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/c0da5738f43fd83cef7cee6b0c2f9ed5\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/c0da5738f43fd83cef7cee6b0c2f9ed5\/href<\/a><p>When the UI and UX were defined, building the web services to support this frontend were intuitively easy. We are using RESTful APIs that provide CRUD (aka Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete) operations for each logically independent entity. In our case the entity is the todo task, and our todo app is supposed to offer functionality to create tasks, retrieve them, update or\u00a0delete.<\/p>\n<p>Each web service we use is very small, completely independent, highly decoupled, focused on context bounded one task, communicating through language-agnostic API. This is the very definition of a microservice, which we adopted by choice and by necessity. And this is where AWS Lambda\u00a0excels!<\/p>\n<p>Next, we will describe the structure of the \u201cCreate Todo\u201d microservice that we deploy on AWS Lambda (the other microservices in this todo app are structured pretty much the same): <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/src\/Todo\/Create\/bootstrap.es6\">bootstrap.es6<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/src\/Todo\/Create\/package.json\">package.json<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Backend\/src\/Todo\/Create\/Handler.es6\">Handler.es6<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c6a0b6ae47ceb5b97b60250277d9e28\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/2c6a0b6ae47ceb5b97b60250277d9e28\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d3fa53fb655562079f6b2078a52ff0f0\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/d3fa53fb655562079f6b2078a52ff0f0\/href<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/cae137a2d3350125d0f490a29025c7c1\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/cae137a2d3350125d0f490a29025c7c1\/href<\/a><h4>Building Database<\/h4>\n<p>The structure of our database model is trivial, just one file: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-microservices-todo-app\/blob\/master\/src\/DeepNgToDo\/Data\/Models\/Todo.json\">Todo.json<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/e4baf60cd4213b0d666196b7a357524d\/href\">https:\/\/medium.com\/media\/e4baf60cd4213b0d666196b7a357524d\/href<\/a><p>Since we\u2019re using a NoSQL database like Amazon DynamoDB, the only piece of information that the database library from DEEP Framework cares about is the table name and the primary key. Everything else is handled by the library itself, as long as it\u2019s in json\u00a0format.<\/p>\n<h4>Enforcing Security<\/h4>\n<p>The beauty of cloud-native approach is that security comes by design. When we deploy todo app, <em>deepify<\/em> automatically identifies the web services involved in the process and creates corresponding security roles. On backend and database tiers these roles are transposed into AWS IAM roles, while on frontend tier we automatically compile them and expose in the UI as Access Control Lists (also known as ACLs).

The big driver for the Mitoc Group behind going serverless was to reduce ongoing maintenance. What better way to maintain fewer servers by not having\u00a0them?<\/p>\n<p>Not only is there the DEEP Framework itself, but there\u2019s also a \u201cmicroapp\u201d store at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deep.mg\/\">www.deep.mg<\/a> where developers can buy and sell small pieces of functionality, like a shopping cart or recommendation engine. It\u2019s still early days for their marketplace, but in the future it could enable developers to build full applications with relatively little\u00a0code.<\/p>\n<h3>The Interview<\/h3>\n<h4>Q: Tell me a little about the DEEP framework, what problem is it\u00a0solving?<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework\">DEEP<\/a> is a serverless web framework that abstracts web applications and web services from specific cloud providers. This framework enables developers build cloud-native applications or platforms using microservices architecture in a completely serverless approach. We aim to help enterprise software and enterprise organizations to build web applications or web services that can be used across cloud providers, enabling the customers to choose between Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure, or others, without having developers to rewrite the\u00a0code.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: I see that there\u2019s an app store for DEEP modules, can you give me any information about how many vendors are making things available through the app store? How many people are getting modules via the app\u00a0store?<\/h4>\n<p>The DEEP Marketplace is a public app store built on top of the DEEP Framework, that empowers customers to choose functionality from listed microservices\/microapplications and deploy them together as an web app into their own cloud provider accounts with just few clicks; as well as empowering developers to create and publish their microservices\/microapplications and monetize them in similar approach to Apple\u2019s App Store. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deep.mg\/\">www.deep.mg<\/a> is currently in private beta, so it\u2019s still very early to talk about it. But, it\u2019s not a secret and to address your curiosity, we have 16 developers publishing microservices\/microapplications and 3 customers using them in production.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Can you talk about the design of the DEEP framework at a high level? What are the different components?<\/h4>\n<p>DEEP Framework is a collection of JavaScript libraries that can be used either in front-end or back-end, depends on the use case. Every library abstracts certain component of an web application or a cloud provider service. They are published through npmjs.com and documented on <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.deep.mg\/\">docs.deep.mg<\/a>. The full list of libraries and some details can be found in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework#what-is-deep-framework-\">README<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Other than Lambda, what other technologies is the DEEP using? This includes frontend, mobile, databases, whatever you can\u00a0share.<\/h4>\n<p>DEEP Framework was built originally on AWS, but we want and hope to extend support using other cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure. In AWS context, we are using the following services:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Security\u200a\u2014\u200aIAM and\u00a0Cognito<\/li>\n<li>Frontend\u200a\u2014\u200aS3 and CloudFront<\/li>\n<li>Backend\u200a\u2014\u200aLambda, API Gateway and\u00a0SNS<\/li>\n<li>Database\u200a\u2014\u200aDynamoDB<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework#roadmap\">roadmap<\/a> includes adding support for services like CloudSearch and Elasticsearch, SQS and Kinesis, VPC and Elasticache.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: How large is the DEEP team? Did any\/all of them have experience with Lambda and Node.js already, or were they coming from other areas of expertise?<\/h4>\n<p>The team that works on DEEP project is pretty small (less than 10 developers). Except <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/eistrati\">@eistrati<\/a>, nobody had prior experience with AWS. It\u2019s a long story, and to make it short, core members of the team worked together on other projects that turned out to be 80%+ of our time support and maintenance. So we forced ourselves into a serverless approach and learned on the fly everything else required to get the job\u00a0done.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: What do you recommend for monitoring with DEEP applications? Is CloudWatch your go-to, or are there other tools you use in addition?<\/h4>\n<p>At the beginning, CloudWatch was our go-to monitoring tool, but it\u2019s very limited in showing the full picture, especially in realtime. We are using an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/webinars\/introduction-elk-stack\">ELK<\/a>(Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana) stack hacked together to solve our measuring and monitoring needs. Now we\u2019re working to transform that solution into a component that any web application or web platform could use, if it\u2019s built with DEEP Framework.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: How does the DEEP framework expect a production pipeline to look? Do you expect users to be developing on their \u201cproduction\u201d account and managing changes with versioning\/aliases?<\/h4>\n<p>DEEP Framework, DEEP Marketplace, and DEEP CLI (aka <em>deepify<\/em>) are components of a bigger Platform-as-a-Service that we call <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework#appendix-b-deep-ecosystem\">Digital Enterprise End-to-end Platform<\/a> (aka\u00a0DEEP).<\/p>\n<p>Production pipeline in context of DEEP Framework + DEEP CLI is focused on developers and makes it easier for them to build, test and deploy serverless applications. For\u00a0example:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>deepify server<\/em>\u200a\u2014\u200asimulates the entire stack on localhost and helps developers build and test their microservice(s)\/microapplication(s) without any need of cloud provider accounts (e.g. AWS accounts)<\/li>\n<li>\n<em>deepify deploy<\/em>\u200a\u2014\u200adeploys the microservice(s)\/microapplication(s) on cloud provider account, into specific environment (e.g. prod, stage, test, dev,\u00a0etc)<\/li>\n<li>Enjoy the web application!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Production pipeline in context of DEEP Framework + DEEP Marketplace is focused on customers, allowing them to search for functionality in UI (no need for technical expertise) and deploy everything in their own cloud provider accounts as an web application. For\u00a0example:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search\/select wanted functionality (or compatible functionalities) and add it (or them) to shopping\u00a0cart<\/li>\n<li>Go to checkout page, provide credit card (pay for licensing the code) and provide cloud provider account credentials (point where the code will be\u00a0loaded)<\/li>\n<li>Enjoy the web application!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In both cases, DEEP ecosystem manages (and encourages, but doesn\u2019t enforce) environments\/versioning\/aliases for the users (developers or customers). Where appropriate, we ask for confirmations from users and apply changes to existing stacks. At some point in near future, we\u2019d like to build a process that is very close to blue-green deployments.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Was there anything that surprised you along the way? Were certain tasks easier or harder than you\u2019d expected?<\/h4>\n<p>Well, this is a tricky question.

There\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework\">DEEP Framework<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/serverless.com\/\">Serverless<\/a> (formerly JAWS), <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/braahyan\/PAWS\">PAWS<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mweagle\/Sparta\">Sparta<\/a>. There are likely more that I\u2019m omitting\u200a\u2014\u200aholler on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryan_sb\">@ryan_sb<\/a> if you know of\u00a0one.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we\u2019ll hear from the creators of the DEEP Framework about its origins, what it\u2019s great at, and how to start using it. The big driver for the Mitoc Group behind going serverless was to reduce ongoing maintenance. What better way to maintain fewer servers by not having\u00a0them?<\/p>\n<p>Not only is there the DEEP Framework itself, but there\u2019s also a \u201cmicroapp\u201d store at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deep.mg\/\">www.deep.mg<\/a> where developers can buy and sell small pieces of functionality, like a shopping cart or recommendation engine. It\u2019s still early days for their marketplace, but in the future it could enable developers to build full applications with relatively little\u00a0code.<\/p>\n<h3>The Interview<\/h3>\n<h4>Q: Tell me a little about the DEEP framework, what problem is it\u00a0solving?<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework\">DEEP<\/a> is a serverless web framework that abstracts web applications and web services from specific cloud providers. This framework enables developers build cloud-native applications or platforms using microservices architecture in a completely serverless approach. We aim to help enterprise software and enterprise organizations to build web applications or web services that can be used across cloud providers, enabling the customers to choose between Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure, or others, without having developers to rewrite the\u00a0code.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: I see that there\u2019s an app store for DEEP modules, can you give me any information about how many vendors are making things available through the app store? How many people are getting modules via the app\u00a0store?<\/h4>\n<p>The DEEP Marketplace is a public app store built on top of the DEEP Framework, that empowers customers to choose functionality from listed microservices\/microapplications and deploy them together as an web app into their own cloud provider accounts with just few clicks; as well as empowering developers to create and publish their microservices\/microapplications and monetize them in similar approach to Apple\u2019s App Store. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deep.mg\/\">www.deep.mg<\/a> is currently in private beta, so it\u2019s still very early to talk about it. But, it\u2019s not a secret and to address your curiosity, we have 16 developers publishing microservices\/microapplications and 3 customers using them in production.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Can you talk about the design of the DEEP framework at a high level? What are the different components?<\/h4>\n<p>DEEP Framework is a collection of JavaScript libraries that can be used either in front-end or back-end, depends on the use case. Every library abstracts certain component of an web application or a cloud provider service. They are published through npmjs.com and documented on <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.deep.mg\/\">docs.deep.mg<\/a>. The full list of libraries and some details can be found in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework#what-is-deep-framework-\">README<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Other than Lambda, what other technologies is the DEEP using? This includes frontend, mobile, databases, whatever you can\u00a0share.<\/h4>\n<p>DEEP Framework was built originally on AWS, but we want and hope to extend support using other cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure. In AWS context, we are using the following services:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Security\u200a\u2014\u200aIAM and\u00a0Cognito<\/li>\n<li>Frontend\u200a\u2014\u200aS3 and CloudFront<\/li>\n<li>Backend\u200a\u2014\u200aLambda, API Gateway and\u00a0SNS<\/li>\n<li>Database\u200a\u2014\u200aDynamoDB<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework#roadmap\">roadmap<\/a> includes adding support for services like CloudSearch and Elasticsearch, SQS and Kinesis, VPC and Elasticache.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: How large is the DEEP team? Did any\/all of them have experience with Lambda and Node.js already, or were they coming from other areas of expertise?<\/h4>\n<p>The team that works on DEEP project is pretty small (less than 10 developers). Except <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/eistrati\">@eistrati<\/a>, nobody had prior experience with AWS. It\u2019s a long story, and to make it short, core members of the team worked together on other projects that turned out to be 80%+ of our time support and maintenance. So we forced ourselves into a serverless approach and learned on the fly everything else required to get the job\u00a0done.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: What do you recommend for monitoring with DEEP applications? Is CloudWatch your go-to, or are there other tools you use in addition?<\/h4>\n<p>At the beginning, CloudWatch was our go-to monitoring tool, but it\u2019s very limited in showing the full picture, especially in realtime. We are using an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/webinars\/introduction-elk-stack\">ELK<\/a>(Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana) stack hacked together to solve our measuring and monitoring needs. Now we\u2019re working to transform that solution into a component that any web application or web platform could use, if it\u2019s built with DEEP Framework.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: How does the DEEP framework expect a production pipeline to look? Do you expect users to be developing on their \u201cproduction\u201d account and managing changes with versioning\/aliases?<\/h4>\n<p>DEEP Framework, DEEP Marketplace, and DEEP CLI (aka <em>deepify<\/em>) are components of a bigger Platform-as-a-Service that we call <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/MitocGroup\/deep-framework#appendix-b-deep-ecosystem\">Digital Enterprise End-to-end Platform<\/a> (aka\u00a0DEEP).<\/p>\n<p>Production pipeline in context of DEEP Framework + DEEP CLI is focused on developers and makes it easier for them to build, test and deploy serverless applications. For\u00a0example:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>deepify server<\/em>\u200a\u2014\u200asimulates the entire stack on localhost and helps developers build and test their microservice(s)\/microapplication(s) without any need of cloud provider accounts (e.g. AWS accounts)<\/li>\n<li>\n<em>deepify deploy<\/em>\u200a\u2014\u200adeploys the microservice(s)\/microapplication(s) on cloud provider account, into specific environment (e.g. prod, stage, test, dev,\u00a0etc)<\/li>\n<li>Enjoy the web application!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Production pipeline in context of DEEP Framework + DEEP Marketplace is focused on customers, allowing them to search for functionality in UI (no need for technical expertise) and deploy everything in their own cloud provider accounts as an web application. For\u00a0example:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search\/select wanted functionality (or compatible functionalities) and add it (or them) to shopping\u00a0cart<\/li>\n<li>Go to checkout page, provide credit card (pay for licensing the code) and provide cloud provider account credentials (point where the code will be\u00a0loaded)<\/li>\n<li>Enjoy the web application!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In both cases, DEEP ecosystem manages (and encourages, but doesn\u2019t enforce) environments\/versioning\/aliases for the users (developers or customers). Where appropriate, we ask for confirmations from users and apply changes to existing stacks. At some point in near future, we\u2019d like to build a process that is very close to blue-green deployments.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Was there anything that surprised you along the way? Were certain tasks easier or harder than you\u2019d expected?<\/h4>\n<p>Well, this is a tricky question. Since almost everything for us was new, we had lots of questions and misperceptions on certain things, but with help and support from the community and AWS, every task that was hard at the beginning turned up easy at the end. The biggest surprise was to be spotted by AWS Lambda team and invited to speak at AWS re:Invent 2015, the breakout session called \u201cMicroservices Architecture for Digital Platforms with AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon DynamoDB\u201d.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Are there any tools or libraries you\u2019ve used to build DEEP, or that you use alongside DEEP that you want people to know\u00a0about?<\/h4>\n<p>DEEP Framework is open source project, built on top of <strong>tons<\/strong> of other open source projects from Github.
